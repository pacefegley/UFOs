# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to compile records of UFO sitings for review by ufologists and organize them in a way that is easy for anyone to parse based on multiple criteria.

## Results
This webpage makes it easy to drill down and see only the records you're looking for in a no-code environment. For example, below I have drilled down with the filter search fields to only the records from El Cajon, CA.

Easy access to this data should make our records very accessible to a wide variety of people.

## Summary
One drawback of this data is that we only have records for the United States. Gathering data from worldwide events would probably garner more interest and engagement. Another issue with this data is that it's not very well formatted for distribution to the public. Having everything in lower case letters with no punctuation is fine for the research team, but I would have liked to have cleaned up the dataset prior to public dissemination. Lastly, the dataset is fairly small. Exploring further data collection would make this much more useful.
